Its real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was 35% higher than it was in 2002, unemployment was 2.3% and government debt was a modest 27% of GDP.\nHowever, the assets of its three largest banks had grown to over nine times GDP, a size that made it impossible for the Icelandic central bank to act as an effective lender of last resort.\nThus, regardless of the quality of the banks' assets, the predictable consequence was a bank run and the subsequent collapse of the Icelandic banking system.\nFollowing the demise of its banks, Iceland imposed capital controls to prevent massive outflows and a plunge in the value of its currency.\nRecapitalisation of its banking system and other crisis-related expenses caused government debt to rise to 95% of GDP by 2011.\nHowever, a successful International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme cushioned the impact: real GDP fell by a less-than-expected 6.6% in 2009 and 4.1% in 2010, before returning to growth.\nIcelandic authorities protected the holders of domestic deposits, who enjoyed uninterrupted access to their accounts; the UK and Dutch governments stepped in to protect deposit holders in UK and Dutch branches of Icelandic banks.\nIn 2013, the European Free Trade Association (Efta) court ruled that Iceland did not breach its obligations, either by treating domestic deposits differently or by not accepting legal obligation for foreign branch deposits.\nToday, Iceland faces the difficult challenge of removing its capital controls in an orderly fashion but the IMF expects real GDP growth of 4.1% in 2015.\nIn 2008, the Cypriot economy was more like that of an emerging market nation than a modern European one, but the country was enjoying an economic boom.\nCypriot real GDP had grown by 27% between 2002 and 2008. The growth, however, had been fuelled by inflows of foreign bank deposits and foreign loans to banks.\nAs a result, the assets of commercial banks with Cypriot parents expanded to over five times' Cypriot GDP.\nUnlike the Icelandic banks, the Cypriot banks had a credible lender of last resort: their central bank was a member of the Eurosystem.\nUnfortunately, they were heavily exposed to Greece.\nCypriot banks were hit hard by the restructuring of Greek sovereign debt in 2012.\nIn March 2013, the Cypriot authorities were in a desperate situation. Either they had to make a sizable contribution to a European Stability Mechanism/IMF rescue package or the emergency loans Cypriot banks had been receiving through its central bank would be cut off.\nWithout the rescue package, saving the Cypriot banking system would be likely to require exiting from the euro area, adopting a new currency and recapitalising the banks by printing money.\nThis would cause the value of the new currency to plummet, taking with it the real value of Cypriot pensions, wages and bank accounts.\nTo avoid catastrophe, the Cypriot authorities looked to the one source of readily available funds: Cypriot bank deposits. Initially they planned to impose a levy on all deposits but ultimately insured depositors were spared.\nTo stem a run, capital controls were imposed. Banks were closed for two weeks and when they were reopened there was a limit on daily withdrawals.\nReal GDP fell by 2.4% in 2012, 5.4% in 2013 and 2.3% in 2014. Unemployment rose to 16.2% in 2014 and government debt has climbed to 107% of GDP.\nCurrently, the outlook for Cyprus is guarded.\nThe country finally returned to economic growth this year and the capital controls were removed entirely in April. However, further economic reform is necessary to ensure sustainable growth.\nGreece currently faces a choice similar to the one faced by Cyprus in 2013.\nIts banking system depends for its survival on emergency lending controlled by the ECB.\nBank runs have forced the imposition of capital controls, temporary bank closures and limits on deposit withdrawals.\nThe consequences of leaving the Eurosystem are likely to be as dire for Greece as they would have been for Cyprus. Reaching an accommodation with its creditors is the preferred outcome.\nReal GDP has fallen by almost 30% in Greece since 2007, partly because of severe fiscal austerity.\nUnemployment was 26% in 2014 and there has been an exodus of skilled labour.\nAs with Cyprus, and unlike with Iceland, any lasting recovery will require significant economic and fiscal reform.\nGreece ranks 61st in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index, edging out Russia and Cyprus (at 64) but behind Tunisia; Iceland is 12th.\nGovernment debt was already a massive 113% of annual GDP in 2008 and now stands at 180%.\nCapital controls were necessary in Iceland and Cyprus, and in Greece today, but they come at a cost.\nMany view them as an assault on civil liberties; others see them as a chance to profit.\nEven in Iceland, a remote island nation, evasion and avoidance appear to have been widespread.\nSome say they promote disrespect for the law and the belief that once again the wealthy, sophisticated and corrupt are benefiting at the expense of the rest of society.\nAnne Sibert is a professor of Economics at Birkbeck, University of London, a fellow of the Centre for Economic Policy Research. She is a former member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Iceland.",

However, the rapid expansion led to an unsustainable situation, where three of its largest banks had assets over nine times GDP, making it impossible for the central bank to act as a lender of last resort.\n\nAs a result, Iceland implemented capital controls in 2008 to prevent a bank run and plunge in currency value. The program was successful, but real GDP fell by less than expected, and government debt rose to 95% of GDP by 2011.\n\nIn response to the crisis, both Iceland and Cyprus faced difficult choices: removing or maintaining capital controls. In 2013, the European Free Trade Association (Efta) court ruled that neither country breached their obligations, but Iceland and Cyprus ultimately adopted similar measures.\n\nToday, in Greece, bank runs and capital controls have forced emergency lending by the European Central Bank (ECB), limiting deposit withdrawals and causing significant economic hardship. The situation is similar to those faced by Iceland and Cyprus, with high levels of government debt (113% of GDP) and unemployment (26%).\n\nGreece's economic challenges are compounded by a lack of reform in key sectors, including tax evasion and avoidance, which have led to widespread criticism.",

The common thread is that all three countries faced bank runs and subsequent collapse due to excessive lending by their banks. To mitigate the damage, each country imposed capital controls, which limited outflows of deposits and prevented a currency crisis.\n\n* Iceland's banking system collapsed in 2008, but it recovered with IMF support.\n* Cyprus was hit hard by its exposure to Greece and had to implement emergency measures to stabilize its banks.\n* Greece is currently facing a similar crisis, relying on ECB emergency lending to survive. The country faces significant economic reform to achieve sustainable growth.\n\nThe capital controls imposed in these countries have come at a cost, with some arguing they promote disrespect for the law and favor the wealthy over the general population.",
    "llm_answer_qwen3_1_7b": "**Summary:**  \nIn 2007, Iceland’s economy appeared robust, but its banks held excessive assets (nine times GDP), preventing the central bank from acting as a lender of last resort, leading to a bank run and collapse. Capital controls were imposed, and the government debt surged to 95% of GDP by 2011. The IMF’s rescue program stabilized growth, with real GDP returning to expansion. Iceland’s authorities protected deposit holders and avoided EU sanctions.  \n\nCypriot banks, similarly exposed to Greece, faced a crisis in 2012 due to sovereign debt restructuring. The Cypriot government relied on capital controls and IMF loans, leading to GDP declines (2.4% in 2012, 5.4% in 2013) and rising debt (107% of GDP). After 2014, capital controls were removed, but reforms are needed for sustainable growth.  \n\nGreece faces a similar crisis, with a 30% GDP decline since 2007, high debt (180% of GDP), and potential exit from the euro. Its banking system depends on ECB emergency loans, and capital controls may force austerity or currency devaluation. While Greece’s recovery requires fiscal reforms, its situation mirrors Cyprus’s challenges.  \n\nKey lessons: Excessive bank assets, lack of a credible lender of last resort, and reliance on external support are critical factors in crisis management. Capital controls and IMF interventions are often necessary but come with economic trade-offs.",

Iceland implemented capital controls to protect depositors and avoid leaving the Eurosystem. A successful IMF program cushioned a decline in Iceland's GDP but left government debt higher at 95% of GDP by 2011. Cyprus faced a banking crisis due to Greek sovereign debt restructuring, leading to severe economic consequences: real GDP fell, unemployment rose, and capital controls were imposed. Despite partial recovery this year, Cyprus still requires economic reform for sustainable growth.

    "context": "Each evening Cardiff Bay will become the venue for a world music Showcase Festival featuring a tapas of world music from around the world.\nFolk music played a large part in this year's opening ceremony featuring Cerys Matthews and other leading Welsh musicians taking the audience on a journey of Welsh music and culture spanning 30,000 years.\nWe asked ten of the leading exponents of Wales' folk music to share songs that best represent what makes each tradition so unique.\nThe earliest surviving manuscript of harp music in Europe - the manuscript of Robert ap Huw, comes from Wales.\n\"The tablature of the Ap Huw manuscripts provide a vital insight into early, traditional music and his music is still celebrated and performed widely\" said internationally renowned harpist, Catrin Finch.\n\"Caniad Y Gwyn Bibydd\" (The Song of the White Piper) demonstrates his music's amazing ability to sound contemporary, even though it was written nearly five centuries ago.\"\nThis unique tradition of singing or chanting poetry to harp accompaniment is a direct descendent of the form used by early bards to intone poetry in praise of their kings and princes.\nGwenan Gibard, a musician and leading exponent of the tradition chose the track  Bum Yn Caru Cainc Y Datgeiniad by one of the old style singers, Einion Edwards, from Meirionydd - a stronghold of the tradition for centuries.\nConsidered by many to be Wales's national instrument, the triple harp was brought to Britain from continental Europe in around 1630. It became popular with harpists in London, many of whom were Welsh and brought it to Wales where it became popular amongst the Gipsy community.\n\"The 'shimmering' voice of the Triple Harp's three rows of strings is truly as timeless and unique as the Welsh language itself\" said Robin Huw Bowen, a full-time professional Welsh harpist specializing solely in the Welsh Triple Harp.\nThe track Pwt Ar Y Bys (Fingering Vamp) shows off the harp's capability and the Welsh tradition to great effect.\nIn many parts of Wales Christmas Day meant attending an early plygain service between 3-6am at the parish church.\nSinger Arfon Gwilym was brought up in the tradition and explains more: \"The plygain tradition survives mainly in Montgomeryshire and takes place in churches and chapels over a six week period during Christmas and the new year.\"\n\"After a short service, the plygain is declared open and anyone in the audience can take part, as individuals or as small parties, the most common party being three people, singing in close harmony. The singing is always unaccompanied and in the past was dominated by men who sang in a simple folk style that was unique.\"\nListen to Ar Gyfer Heddiw'r Bore by Triawd Fronheulog.\nWelsh ballads are still widely performed in their traditional forms but new generations of musicians are revisiting them and performing the songs in more contemporary styles, ensuring they remain relevant. In recent years, folk singer SiÃ¢n James has been at the forefront of this movement:\n\"A ballad which caught my imagination from a very young age was the very beautiful Yr Eneth gadd ei gwrthod (The rejected maiden) - a 19th Century ballad from the Cynwyd area near Bala, which tells the story of a young girl who, finding herself pregnant out of wedlock, is thrown out of her family home by her father, ostracised by her community and left destitute.\"\n\"It ends with the girl drowning herself. She is found with a water-sodden note in her hand, asking to be buried without a headstone, so her existence would be forgotten.\"\nDue to the work of enlightened individuals such as Lady Llanover in the 18th Century, a good many of Wales' traditional dance reels (folk dance and accompanying dance tune type) have survived. Stephen Rees is one of Wales's leading folk musicians and musicologists:\n\"This recording of Pibddawns y Sipsi performed by Nansi Richards, the original 'Queen of the Welsh Harp' conveys the 'hwyl' or spirit of our traditional dance music.\"\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, migrant workers from across the world flocked to Wales' coalfields, slate quarries and docks. The impact on small, Welsh speaking communities was immense and this period ignited a tradition of mixed language songs known as Macaronic.\nCerys Matthews is a huge fan and chose CÃ¢n Merthyr as one of her favourites. Initially, Macaronic songs were thought to be an oral tradition but handwritten records do exist in the National Library of Wales archives dated 1909.\nIts words are said to have been sold on the pamphlet of a ballad-singer at Merthyr Tydfil around the mid-19th Century.\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw a surge in Welsh language activism. While the rest of the western world was engaged in the hippy movement and the 'summer of love', Wales was rediscovering its folk music and traditions, fuelled by a surge in the popularity of Celtic music.\n\"We formed Ar Log in 1976, with the dream of being able to earn a living solely by playing traditional Welsh music\" said Dafydd Roberts, one of the founding members of Ar Log.\n\"By the early eighties Ar Log was travelling Europe and North & South America for around nine months of the year with a wealth of traditional Welsh folk music at our disposal, from haunting love songs and harp airs, to melodic dance tunes, and rousing sea shanties.\"\nThis medley of traditional folk songs comes from Ar Log's own repertoire: Twll yn y to / Cymro o Ble / Pedwar Post y Gwely\nDafydd Iwan is a singer-composer and political activist and campaigned during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s for official status for the Welsh language with Cymdeithas Yr Iaith, the Welsh Language Movement.\n\"Songs have been a natural medium for expressing strong emotions and political protest for centuries, and here in Wales there is a long tradition of ballads with a strong social and political theme,\" he said.\nPeintio'r Byd Yn Wyrdd (Painting the world green) grew out of the road-signs campaign for the Welsh language.\nMore and more young musicians are turning to the folk tradition for inspiration and helping to drive creative experimentation and collaborations.\nWelsh poet and singer-songwriter Gwyneth Glyn has recently been working on such a project with musicians from India and singer Tauseef Akhrar from Mumbai and incorporates Indian violin, tabla and Welsh harp.\nAnother recent project entitled Mamiaith (Mother Tongue), saw Welsh folk group 9Bach collaborate with Australian group Black Arm Band to explore the poignant theme of lost language. Gwyneth chose the track Cariad Mam (Mother's Love) from that album.\nToday, musical tradition in Wales is thriving as younger musicians turn to folk music for inspiration but continue to develop it further with rich musical collaborations around the world.\nWOMEX - The World's Music Comes To Wales is broadcast on BBC Two Wales, Sunday 27 October at 22:00 BST.",

The attackers targeted Kohler's home to either steal items or collect a debt. They included two men—Mariusz Tomaszewski and Pawel Honc—who were sentenced to 19 years each for causing grievous bodily harm with intent, aggravated burglary, and drug/alcohol influence during the attack. Oskar Pawlowicz and Dawid Tychon, who admitted to aggravated burglary, were sentenced to 13 years each.\n\nJudge Susan Tapping stated that all defendants had been under the influence of drugs and alcohol at the time of the incident and likely chose Kohler's home either for potential theft or as a target due to their debt. The judge also noted that all except Honc had criminal records, including serious offenses such as assault and affray in both their home country and UK.\n\nDuring the attack, Paul Kohler was held down on the floor while his wife Samantha MacArthur, daughter Eloise, and her boyfriend Geraint were upstairs. One of the attackers sat on Kohler and repeatedly punched him in the face. The physical injuries included a fractured eye socket, broken nose, and bruising that left Kohler unrecognizable. He has continued to experience double-vision in his left eye.\n\nHonc was under no fixed address; Tomaszewski, Pawlowicz, and Tychon were all Polish nationals from Mitcham. Mr. Kohler's wife Samantha MacArthur and daughter Eloise were able to call the police after hiding in a bedroom. The judge acknowledged that this attack had a significant psychological impact on Kohler and his family.\n\nThe attackers' actions are described as \"utterly unnecessary\" by investigating officer Det Insp Dan O'Sullivan, who also highlighted the lasting effects of the incident on Mr. Kohler and his family, particularly his wife and daughter."

As a result, you have seen the action that has been taken.\n\"The prime minister believes that the right and necessary course of action has been taken, based on the facts that he asked for.\"\nThe spokesman added: \"Now all the focus is on the issues around risks to children linked to extremism and the like in some parts of the UK.\"",

The Dons have strengthened their home fortress, boasting a 10-game winning streak.  \n\nMeanwhile, Pedro Caixinha’s managerial style, marked by unconventional tactics (e.g., revealing team line-ups early and altering strategies), has drawn criticism. Former Rangers player Thompson notes the contrast between Caixinha’s risk-taking and his predecessor’s structured approach, while acknowledging the potential for future recruitment and success. The focus remains on Aberdeen’s cup run and Caixinha’s ability to balance innovation with results.",

Despite the team's current 12-point lead over Rangers, many believe they are the top contenders for second place and will likely remain there despite upcoming challenges from Celtic and Hearts.\n\nThompson emphasizes that even if Rangers wins their next match against Aberdeen on Sunday, he expects them to finish in second place at season's end. He also notes that Aberdeen's home performances have been impressive throughout the season.\n\nRegarding Rangers' new manager Pedro Caixinha, Thompson expresses surprise at his decision to reveal the team lineup a day before the match, stating it would give the opposition additional preparation time and insight into their opponent's tactics. Additionally, he criticizes Caixinha for making significant changes to the team line-up during matches, which could raise suspicions about tactical flexibility.\n\nOverall, the article suggests that both teams have shown consistent performance this season but cautions against prematurely judging new manager Pedro Caixinha at Rangers."

The lawsuit seeks to remove cashier desks and eliminate fee charges, while the museum claims its policy ensures access for all, even if visitors pay full price (40% of visitors).

    "llm_answer_smollm2_latest": "The Metropolitan Museum of Art has faced criticism over its changing policy regarding admission fees, with some signs stating \"recommended\" while others list prices that would require full payment. The museum argues that it is following long-standing guidelines and does not deceive visitors. However, a lawsuit filed in New York City contends the museum's use of misleading marketing and cashier training to charge full price violates an 1893 law mandating free admission at least five days per week for tourists. Lawyers claim the policy misleads visitors and aims to increase revenue by using the word \"recommended\" instead of \"suggested.\" The Met argues its fees are necessary due to grants from city funds, but critics demand complete removal of such fees and the elimination of cashier stations.",
    "summarization_reason_smollm2_latest": "The score is 0.00 because the summary demonstrates a severe lack of accuracy and fidelity to the original text. It introduces numerous contradictions, asserting claims not found in the original, such as the museum adhering to guidelines versus arguing necessity of fees, and the museum violating an 1893 law. Furthermore, it adds entirely extraneous details – the demands of critics – absent from the original. The presence of a question that the original text answers but the summary doesn't highlights a fundamental failure in conveying the source material.",

    "llm_answer_qwen2_5_3b": "The lawsuit filed by former patrons against the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) in New York City alleges that the museum's current admissions policy, which allows for full-price admission but indicates \"recommended\" pricing on signs, violates a 1893 law requiring free public admission at least five days and two evenings per week. The lawsuit claims the MET uses misleading marketing and cashier training to deceive visitors who did not know the difference between \"suggested\" and \"recommended\" prices.\n\nThe museum counters that its policy has been in place for over four decades, making no effort to mislead patrons. They argue that a 1893 law is superseded by their longstanding agreement with New York City, which grants them permission to charge admission fees contingent on financial support from visitors. The lawsuit seeks reimbursement for those misled and a change in the admissions policy.\n\nThe MET asserts that its charges ensure free access for all, as about 40% of visitors pay full price due to city agreements, covering up to 11% of their operating expenses with city grants. They maintain that the museum's policies are justified by its financial strength and commitment to accessibility for all, despite other prominent NYC museums charging admission fees.\n\nThe court case involves a conflict between New York City's historic laws on public access and modern admissions practices at one of the world’s wealthiest and most popular art museums.",
    "summarization_reason_qwen2_5_3b": "The summarization score of 0.60 is appropriate. The summary successfully captured the core focus of the original text, which is about the Metropolitan Museum of Art's funding and its impact on visitor experience. However, the inclusion of the two added statements – that the text states it contains a summary and details about city grants and visitor pricing – is extraneous and dilutes the focus of the original text, thus lowering the quality of the summary.",
